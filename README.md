# Destination-Scuba
Destination Scuba is a recommender for scuba diving sites and business. Each business and site also has some defining keywords that are extracted from the reviews.

The main algorithm can be found in DS_retriever.py and in the folder ReviewClumping. The DS_retriever.py uses DiveBuddy and Yelp data retrieved from each site, along with the review keywords generated by ReviewClumping to return the top n results in a location (within a specific distance). For demonstration purposes, the algorithm returns the url, review keywords, and a simple ranking metric (where higher is better).  When implemented on the actual website, more information will be returned such as the title, location, rating, etc.

To use DS_retriever.py you must type...  
"python DS_retriever.py LATITUDE LONGITUDE N"
