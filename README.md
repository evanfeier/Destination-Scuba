# Destination Scuba
Destination Scuba is a recommender for scuba diving sites and business. It provides nearby scuba businesses and diving locations so that you can plan your perfect underwater vacation without ever leaving home!

The main algorithm can be found in DS_retriever.py and in the folder ReviewClumping. The DS_retriever.py uses DiveBuddy and Yelp data retrieved from each site, along with the review keywords generated by ReviewClumping to return the top n results in a location (within a specific distance). For demonstration purposes, the algorithm returns the url, review keywords, and a simple ranking metric (where higher is better).  When implemented on the actual website, more information will be returned such as the title, location, rating, etc.

The Destination Scuba command-line interface can be called using
```shell
python DS_retriever.py LATITUDE LONGITUDE N
```
Examples:  
```shell
  python DS_retriever.py 44.338398 -75.919733 10
  python DS_retriever.py 26.448723 -80.066601 10
  python DS_retriever.py 42.60132 -83.11994 10
```
