# Destination Scuba
Destination Scuba is a recommender for scuba diving sites and business. It provides access to hundreds of scuba businesses and diving locations so that you can plan your perfect underwater vacation without ever leaving home!

The main algorithm can be found in DS_retriever.py and in the folder ReviewClumping. The DS_retriever.py uses DiveBuddy and Yelp data retrieved from each site, along with the review keywords generated by ReviewClumping to return the top n results in a location (within a specific distance).  Our system then ranks these results according to a weighting of a variety of factors including rating, number of reviews, and distance.
